# dotfiles

They are a mess.
Sorry.

## Installation (linux)

### Config files
Just softlink them :)
You can use `link.sh` script for that.

### Arch packages
Packages are listed in `pkglist` folder. Install them using `pkglist/install_packages.sh` with txt file name.

There are two custom packages in their dedicated folders:
* dmenu - with fuzzy finding patch added
* st - with custom config

### Install scripts
In the `install` folder.

### Setup scripts
In the `setup` folder.

## Windows
`link.ps1` to link the profile, open a new `pwsh` session and everything *should* be set up.
